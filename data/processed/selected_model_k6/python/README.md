# Selected Python K6 CoGAPS Artifacts

This folder contains the Python/PyCoGAPS-compatible artifacts for the selected `K = 6`, `seed = 2`, `n_iter = 2000`, sparse-on model.

The case-study text treats R/Bioconductor CoGAPS as the primary implementation. These Python artifacts are used in parallel Python tabs so learners can see the same workflow in Python without making implementation comparison the main objective. Pattern labels are run-specific; the IFN-associated Python pattern is `Pattern5`, while the primary R K6 run labels the corresponding signal `Pattern4`.

## Full-Local File

- `cogaps_K6_seed2_iter2000.h5ad`: optional full Python saved model object for local full-result workflows.

This file is useful when a reviewer or developer wants to inspect the complete saved PyCoGAPS object or regenerate derived artifacts. It is intentionally optional for GitHub/classroom rendering because it is much larger than the lightweight cooking-show files.

## Lightweight Cooking-Show Files

These files are the default Python path when the full `.h5ad` is absent:

- `cogaps_K6_seed2_iter2000.metrics.json`: selected Python model metadata.
- `pattern_gene_weights.tsv.gz`: exported gene-weight (`A`) matrix.
- `pattern_cell_activities.tsv.gz`: exported cell-activity (`P`) matrix.
- `pattern_cell_activities_with_metadata.csv.gz`: cell-level pattern activities joined to metadata and embeddings.
- `pattern_top_genes.csv`: top genes per pattern.
- `pattern_correlations.csv`: pattern correlations with the stimulation indicator.
- `pattern_activity_by_celltype_condition.csv`: compact activity summaries by cell type and condition.
- `pattern_activity_by_replicate_condition.csv`: donor-aware activity summaries.
- `pattern_summary.csv`: compact per-pattern interpretation table.
- `pattern_gene_directionality_global.csv`: targeted global directionality for top pattern genes.
- `pattern_gene_directionality_by_celltype.csv`: targeted cell-type directionality for top pattern genes.
- `pattern_direction_summary.csv`: one-row directionality summary per pattern.
- `pattern_gene_directionality_pairs_global.csv`: donor-paired global log2FC values.
- `pattern_gene_directionality_pairs_by_celltype.csv`: donor-paired cell-type log2FC values.
- `pattern_gene_directionality_heatmap.png`: heatmap of global top-gene directionality.
- `pseudobulk_counts_global.csv`: global pseudobulk counts used for directionality summaries.
- `pseudobulk_counts_by_celltype.csv`: cell-type pseudobulk counts used for directionality summaries.

## Directionality Notes

CoGAPS weights identify genes associated with each pattern, but they do not by themselves indicate whether those genes are up- or down-regulated. Direction was estimated separately from the underlying count data by comparing IFN-beta stimulated cells to control cells with replicate-aware pseudobulk summaries.

- `Pattern5` is treated as the IFN-associated pattern for this Python run.
- `Pattern5`: 14 of 15 top genes are up in stimulation by the global paired pseudobulk summary.
- This supports using directionality as evidence for interpreting the IFN-associated pattern, while keeping non-IFN or additional stimulation-associated pattern labels cautious.

## Caveats

- This is a targeted directionality check for pattern genes, not a genome-wide differential-expression analysis.
- The by-cell-type summaries are descriptive and depend on cell counts per donor/condition/cell-type stratum.
- The current dataset is an IFN-beta stimulation PBMC dataset; any dengue interpretation should be framed as biological relevance to IFN/inflammatory programs, not direct dengue infection evidence.
